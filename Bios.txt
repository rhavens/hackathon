Justin "Twitch" Lee

	Born in the land of milk and honey (Hong Kong), Justin is the glue that holds the development team together. Not only did he master Parse, Python, and Parseltongue simultaneously in 2 hours, but he also has really cool glasses [citation needed] that he got on ebay for a really good deal. In his free time, he plays fetch with his peacock Mitch, who also happens to be our mascot.

Ryan "Meg" Havens

	Hailing from New York City, Ryan is the brains of the operations. He wrote the majority of this site's code blindfolded, typing only with his majestic facial hair. When he's not hacking school networks and google, Ryan freestyles at the House of Blues (his rapper name is "the Megizzle"). Though he would never admit it, the most important thing in his life is his deep friendship with Justin's peacock, Mitch.

David "Xeno" Bernstein

	Nerd legend tells the story of a man who wrote the Python language while coming out of his mother's womb; this is not his story. David, born in Atlanta Georgia, is the Capri Sun Pouch that provides the creative juices for the team. When he's not cracking bad puns that your dad's dad would groan at, David can be found trying to do something that he definitely should not be doing.
