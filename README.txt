Our project is currently hosted at http://coursecomparator.herokuapp.com

It also runs in the command line with "python app.py".

We sought to put an end to the frequent debates and infighting amongst Tufts
students by finally, once and for all, settling the ultimate question:

Whose schedule is hardest?

At Tufts Course Online Comparator (TCOC), we not only solve this dilemma once
and for all but also present the information in a pristine, beautiful format.

For each of us, it was our first hackathon. None of us had much experience in
web programming, but through trials and tribulations we somehow managed to
produce something we're all quite proud of. From learning Python to managing
Parse databases to publishing cloud applications, we made the transformation
from novice programmers to gritty hackers.
