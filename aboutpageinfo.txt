"Have you seen my schedule yet? It's so hard!"

How many times have you heard this? Everyone wants some validation and/or sympathy because of their masochistic schedules. Of course, everyone wants to brag about how much work they have to do and whatnot; however, there has not really been any way to simply and concretely quantify just how hard one's schedule is, until now. 

Enter Tufts Course Comparator

We at TCoC believe that everyone has the right to brag about their schedule, no matter whether or not it is legitimately hard. We encourage you to add your own schedule so that you can find your TCoC hardness score and share it with your friends.
